I work at Microsoft where I lead a team of cloud architects that help our largest customers design and implement enterprise-scale solutions. Prior to joining Microsoft, I have worked throughout the United States and Europe helping customers in a variety of areas including mobile application development and security. I currently live in Oak Park, Illinois.
